# layout:
#   It's the transform layout used by rozofs. Each file data will be transform
#   in *forward* chunks, only *inverse* of them will be need to reconstruct
#   data (read data), and they will be distributed over *safe* storages.  
#
#       Valid layouts are :
#           - 0 (inverse = 2, forward = 3, safe = 4);
#           - 1 (inverse = 4, forward = 6, safe = 8);
#           - 2 (inverse = 8, forward = 12, safe = 16);

layout = 0; # (inverse = 2, forward = 3, safe = 4)

# volumes:
#   It's a list of volume. Each volume is identified by its vid and may contain
#   a list of one or more clusters (cids). Each clusters is identified by its
#   cid and may contain at least a list of *safe* storages of the same 
#   capacity (sids).
#
#       vid: (volume identifier)
#               - must be an integer.
#               - must be unique for each volume managed by this exportd.
#
#       cid: (cluster identifier)
#               - must be an integer.
#               - must be unique for each cluster managed by this exportd.
#
#       sid: (storage identifier)
#               - must be an integer (between 1 and 255).
#               - must be unique within a cluster.
#
#       host: (IP or hostname of the physical node that contains the storage)
#               - must be a valid IPv4 address or a valid hostname.

# --WARNING--
#   - Use a new cluster when scaling with storage of different capacity.
#   - Modifying or removing sid of storage can (will) lead to DATA LOSS !!!
#   - Modifying or removing cid can (will) lead to DATA LOSS !!!

# exports:
#   It's the list of rozo file system exported by the exportd daemon. Each
#   exported file system is identified by its eid. root is the directory path
#   where the metadata for this file system are stored. md5 is a 22 characters
#   md5 crypt of the password required to mount the exported filesystem.
#   squota is the number of data blocks that can be stored on a file system
#   before being notified. hquota is the number maximum of data blocks that can
#   be stored on a file system. vid is the volume where the file data for this
#   exported filesystem will be stored.
#
#       eid: (export identifier)
#               - must be an integer.
#               - must be unique for each exported filesystem managed by this
#                 exportd.
#
#       root: (directory path where metadata for this filesystem will be stored)
#               - must be an existing directory.
#               - must be unique for each filesystem managed by this exportd.
#
#       md5: (22 characters md5 crypt of the password)
#               - it could be generated with: md5 utility (see md5pass (1))
#                 the salt used should be: rozofs. Only the last 22 characters
#                 should be used (omitting newline).
#
#                 Example: 
#                           for password "mypass":
#                           md5 is: md5pass mypass rozofs | cut -c 11-
#                           that is: AyBvjVmNoKAkLQwNa2c4b0
#
#               - For no authentication use empty md5.
#
#       squota: (soft quota)
#               - squota stands for soft quota which are non blocking quotas
#                 i.e write operations will succeeded but exceeded quotas will
#                 be notified in /var/run/exportd/export_[eid] monitoring file.
#               - for no soft quota use empty squota.
#
#       hquota: (hard quota)
#               - hquota stands for blocking quotas which are blocking quotas
#                 i.e every attempt to write beyond hquota will fail (EDQUOT).
#               - for no hard quota use empty hquota.
#
#       for squota and hquota:
#               - quotas are express in nb. of blocks (no suffix), Kilo, Mega or
#                 Giga Bytes accordind to suffix K, M or G. Only the first 
#                 letter of  suffix is used that is: 128G is equivalent to
#                 128Giga wich in turn can be 128GigaBytes etc...
#               - warning: any other suffix leads to quota express in blocks.
#
#       vid: (volume identifier used to store file data for this filesystem)
#               - must be an integer.
#               - should exist in volume list.
#               - several filesystem can use the same volume.
